# Project Name

**Author**: Vince Masten
**Version** 1.0.0

## Overview
A Python module for computing fibonacci and lucas numbers, along with an extensible sum_series function that currently computes either depending on user input. While it could be used in conjunction with other modules, it will also run standalone on the console and allow the user to do computation manually

A number of tests are included in a separate module to ensure correct output and proper input validation

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repo from github.com/vmasten
1. Use the series.py module as desired, or run it with a Python 3.6 interpreter on the command line

## Architecture
Uses Python 3.6.7, pipenv, and pytest
